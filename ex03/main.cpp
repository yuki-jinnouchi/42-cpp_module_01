/*
Implement a Weapon class that has:
• A private attribute type, which is a string.
• A getType() member function that returns
    a const reference to type.
• A setType() member function that sets type
    using the new one passed as parameter.

Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB.
    They both have a Weapon and a name.
    They also have a member function attack()
    that displays (of course, without the angle brackets):
  <name> attacks with their <weapon type>

HumanA and HumanB are almost the same except for
    these two tiny details:
• While HumanA takes
    the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesn’t.
• HumanB may not always have a Weapon,
    whereas HumanA will always be armed.

int main() {
  {
    Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
    HumanA bob("Bob", club);

    bob.attack();
    club.setType("some other type of club");
    bob.attack();
  }
  {
    Weapon club = Weapon("crude spiked club");
    HumanB jim("Jim");

    jim.setWeapon(club);
    jim.attack();
    club.setType("some other type of club");
    jim.attack();
  }
  return 0;
